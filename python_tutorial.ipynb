Some of the more popular projects that use Python are Dropbox, Blender, and games such as Eve Online and Frets on Fire. Python is an open-source language meaning that the code that makes up the language is available for anyone to contribute to, even you! But what is a programming language? A programming language is a language that allows us to communicate instructions to computers. Just as other languages, such as English, have rules that dictate how the language must be written to be read, so do programming languages. In fact, programming languages are stricter. As humans, we can read over spelling errors but computers cannot and so you must make sure to carefully write your code to avoid errors. When you make errors programming, you must read the errors you receive and try to fix these problems. This fixing is known as **debugging**. So let's get started!"]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Variables\n","Variables are named holders of information.

The place is the ones place, the twos place, the fours place, and so on. You may have noticed that in a base ten numbering system you can get the value of the next place by multiplying the previous place by 10. e.g. `1 * 10 = 10, ` and ` 10 * 10 = 100, ` and ` 100 * 10 = 1,000,` and so on.

That is a lot of places for a relatively small number. Because these numbers in binary are so long, numbers in computer science are often shortened using base sixteen called hexadecimal. Base ten doesn't evenly go into base two in that the lengths are not proportional. This is clear with 255 and 256. Again, in binary these require 8 and 9 places but in base ten they both only require 3 places. But base sixteen and base two are proportional. 255 in base hexadecimal—often shortened to hex—is ff. This is because the unique characters in base ten only go up to 9 and so to represent the remaining unique characters in hex we need to use letters. a = 10, b = 11, c = 12, d = 13, e = 14, and finally f = 15. So 0-f is 16 unique characters. Each place in hex represents 4 places in binary. Remember, the 4th place in binary is the sixteens place and the 8th place in binary is the one hundred and twenty eights place. So if we put two hex fs together we get ff which is 8 binary places that represents the number 128. But the left most place doesn't change until the lower place has cycled through all of it's unique characters just like in a base ten system. You don't get 10 without first going through 0-9 in base ten and so you don't get 10 without first going through 0-f in hex. That means 1a which is 26 in base ten is much smaller than a1 which is 161 in base ten. This might be hard to read at first, but with practice you will start to see patterns and translate those patterns to approxiate values that will make it easier to tell quickly what values are bigger. You do this with base ten numbers as well but you have grown up your whole life reading these and no longer think about deciphering them. With practice the same can be true of reading hex.

Finally, we end the line with a colon. This first line of a function is called the **function header**. After the **function header**, the body of the function begins indented by 4 spaces. This indentation made up of four spaces is something most programming languages do not have and is called whitespace. Whitespace are characters that are not necessarily visible to us such as tabs, spaces, and newlines. This whitespace is required in Python and makes reading the code very clear. When you see an indentation, that means that the code belongs to the code above it. Most other languages will let you write hundreds of lines of code on a single line making it impossible to read for a human but still readable to a computer.

Python uses **dynamic typing** which means that variable types are not declared and are only checked when the code runs. Many languages like C and Java have **static typing** where a variable's type is specifically declared such as **int a_number = 5**. **a_number** will always be of the type integer. There are pluses and minuses to each approach. In Python, with **dynamic typing**, you can accidentally reassign a variable a type you did not want. You can see this through the examples above. I keep reassigning the variable **x** to dictionaries, integers, and so on. That could potentially generate an error later in the program that I might not have anticipated.

Well that's broken. How can you have two hands when you only have 1 arm? It's been broken all this time but bugs in our code may not always be immediately found. So let's think about the problem. If you have 1 arm then you should only have at most 1 hand and at most 5 fingers. But you can have 2 arms but only 1 hand and therefore at most 5 fingers. Finally you can have 9 fingers but 2 hands and 2 arms. So fingers are dependent on the hands which are dependent on the arms. We can solve this with a property decorator which allows a method with the same name as an attribute to called instead of a just a plain attribute. Then all other dependent properties can be set with a setter method that also has the same name as the attribute and property decorator method. Another key point is that we need to create another attribute name that holds the actual values for arms, legs, hands, and feet. If we used the same name as our decorator or setter, we would have a mangling of name spaces and each time we tried to access the value of the attribute we would instead stay stuck in a loop calling the decorated method and setter of the same name. To fix this we will create an attribute that leads with an underscore and return that underscored attribute when the property decorator is called for arms, legs, hands, and feet. The underscore hides this extra attribute from accidentaly being accessed. To the user, it seems like these are just attributes but in reality we need to do more behind the scenes to calculate these values. The hiding of this dirty work is called encapsulation. But it should be clear that Python is a language that assumes you are a consenting adult. **These attributes are not really hidden and can easily be accessed if you know how.** The reasoning behind this is that you might have a very good reason to access these hidden attributes. Perhaps you want to do something with the code that the original author did not need to do."]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["class Human():\n","    \"\"\" This class creates a human object.\"\"\"\n","    \n","    def __init__(self, legs=2, feet=2, toes=10,\n","                 arms=2, hands=2, fingers=10, eyes=2):\n","        \"\"\"Set attributes that hold the features of the human\"\"\"\n","        self.legs = legs\n","        self.feet = feet\n","        self.toes = toes\n","        self.arms = arms\n","        self.hands = hands\n","        self.fingers = fingers\n","        self.eyes = eyes\n","        \n","    @property\n","    def legs(self):\n","        return self.__legs\n","    \n","    @legs.setter\n","    def legs(self, legs):\n","        self.__legs = legs\n","        self.feet = 1 * legs\n","        self.toes = 5 * legs\n","    \n","    @property\n","    def feet(self):\n","        return self.__feet\n","    \n","    @feet.setter\n","    def feet(self, feet):\n","        self.__feet = feet\n","        self.toes = 5 * feet\n","        \n","    @property\n","    def arms(self):\n","        return self.__arms\n","    \n","    @arms.setter\n","    def arms(self, arms):\n","        self.__arms = arms\n","        self.hands = 1 * arms\n","        self.fingers = 5 * arms\n","    \n","    @property\n","    def hands(self):\n","        return self.__hands\n","    \n","    @hands.setter\n","    def hands(self, hands):\n","        self.__hands = hands\n","        self.fingers = 5 * hands\n","\n","    def get_name(self):\n","        \"\"\"Prompts for a first and last name\"\"\"\n","        self.first_name = input(\"Enter your first name\\n\")\n","        self.last_name = input(\"Enter your last name\\n\")\n","        \n","    def greeting(self):\n","        \"\"\"Print a greeting\"\"\"\n","        try:\n","            print(\"Hello {} {}!\".format(self.first_name, self.last_name))\n","        except AttributeError:\n","            self.get_name() # If these attributes don't exist and therefore raise an AttributeError call the get_name method\n","            self.greeting() # Recursively call the greeting function after setting the missing attributes"],"execution_count":116,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["baby07 = Human()"],"execution_count":117,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["baby07.arms = 1"],"execution_count":118,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["baby07.hands"],"execution_count":119,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"1"},"metadata":{},"execution_count":119}]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["This looks good so far.

Meaning legs are set before feet so that feet can overwrite the feet attribute set by legs if we provide a keyword argument for feet."]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["class Human():\n","    \"\"\" This class creates a human object.\"\"\"\n","    \n","    def __init__(self, legs=None, feet=None, toes=None,\n","                 arms=None, hands=None, fingers=None, eyes=2):\n","        \"\"\"Set attributes that hold the features of the human\"\"\"\n","        if legs != None:\n","            self.legs = legs\n","        else:\n","            self.legs = 2\n","        if feet != None:\n","            self.feet = feet\n","        if toes != None:\n","            self.toes = toes\n","        if arms != None:\n","            self.arms = arms\n","        else:\n","            self.arms = 2\n","        if hands != None:\n","            self.hands = hands\n","        if fingers != None:\n","            self.fingers = fingers\n","        self.eyes = eyes\n","        \n","    @property\n","    def legs(self):\n","        return self.__legs\n","    \n","    @legs.setter\n","    def legs(self, legs):\n","        self.__legs = legs\n","        self.feet = 1 * legs\n","        self.toes = 5 * legs\n","        print('leg setter run: __legs is {0}, feet is {1}, toes is {2}'.format(self.__legs, self.feet, self.toes))\n","    \n","    @property\n","    def feet(self):\n","        return self.__feet\n","    \n","    @feet.setter\n","    def feet(self, feet):\n","        self.__feet = feet\n","        self.toes = 5 * feet\n","        print('feet setter run: __feet is {0}, toes is {1}'.format(self.__feet, self.toes))\n","        \n","    @property\n","    def arms(self):\n","        return self.__arms\n","    \n","    @arms.setter\n","    def arms(self, arms):\n","        self.__arms = arms\n","        self.hands = 1 * arms\n","        self.fingers = 5 * arms\n","    \n","    @property\n","    def hands(self):\n","        return self.__hands\n","    \n","    @hands.setter\n","    def hands(self, hands):\n","        self.__hands = hands\n","        self.fingers = 5 * hands\n","\n","    def get_name(self):\n","        \"\"\"Prompts for a first and last name\"\"\"\n","        self.first_name = input(\"Enter your first name\\n\")\n","        self.last_name = input(\"Enter your last name\\n\")\n","        \n","    def greeting(self):\n","        \"\"\"Print a greeting\"\"\"\n","        try:\n","            print(\"Hello {} {}!\".format(self.first_name, self.last_name))\n","        except AttributeError:\n","            self.get_name() # If these attributes don't exist and therefore raise an AttributeError call the get_name method\n","            self.greeting() # Recursively call the greeting function after setting the missing attributes"],"execution_count":124,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":false},"cell_type":"code","source":["baby10 = Human(legs=1)"],"execution_count":125,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"feet setter run: __feet is 1, toes is 5\nleg setter run: __legs is 1, feet is 1, toes is 5\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":false},"cell_type":"code","source":["baby10 = Human(feet=1,fingers=9)"],"execution_count":126,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"feet setter run: __feet is 2, toes is 10\nleg setter run: __legs is 2, feet is 2, toes is 10\nfeet setter run: __feet is 1, toes is 5\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["So again we see the feet setter is called twice but it gets the job done.
